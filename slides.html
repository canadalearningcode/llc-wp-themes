        # What is PHP?

        * PHP requires a *server* to run so you can't just open a PHP file in the browser to see the content (like HTML)
        * has been around since the 90s
        * was an acronym for **Personal Home Page** but now stands for **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor** (Yep, that first “P” stands for PHP)
        * can be written on its own or mixed with HTML

        #How much PHP do you need to know?  
        
        This depends on the level of customization required. 
        
        However, much of the customization can be achieved using WordPress [template tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags), which are all documented in the Codex.
        
        We'll also discuss the different levels of customization.

        #Local Development & server
        
        Developing your website *locally* refers to developing it on your computer.
        
        It's better to develop your site locally rather than on a live web server, so you get a chance to test it before the world sees it.
        
        Since WordPress runs on PHP, which is a server-side language, a *server* is needed to run the files. You will need a *local* server to do local development.

Today we'll use [Atom](http://atom.io). <span class="note">(Using another editor is fine but some of the features may be slightly different.)</span>
        
        **A modern web browser:**
        Using a [modern web browser](http://browsehappy.com/) will enhance your web experience as well as give you access to useful dev tools. Today we'll be using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
        
        **Local Server:**
        Today we'll be using the [DesktopServer](https://serverpress.com) from ServerPress.

        <!-- .element: class="note" -->[Mamp](https://www.mamp.info/en/) is a very popular &amp; common option for local servers and has more features than the free version of DesktopServer, but DesktopServer streamlines the WordPress installation process.

        # WordPress Admin
        
        Let's get acquainted with the WordPress Admin area. Getting to know the backend is key to theme customization.  
        
        When using a local server, `http://your-project-name.dev` is the domain. Access the Admin by adding `/wp-admin/` to the end. 
        
        ```
        http://your-project-name.dev/wp-admin/
        ```
        This works for any WordPress site you have admin access to, whether it's a live or local site.<!-- .element: class="note" -->
        
        If you're logged in, you can access it from the admin toolbar by selecting your site name. Click on it again to get back to your site.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/admin-login.gif)
        
        **Pro tip!**  Open a new browser tab and navigate to your Admin area there.  That way you can have both your site and your Admin options open at the same time for easy access and testing.

        1. Add 2-3 **posts** (anything you want!)
          * include some paragraphs, headings and at least one image
          * add a **featured image** to at least 1 post
        1. Add a `Home` **page** and another 1-2 pages (e.g. About, Contact) 
          * include some paragraphs, headings and at least one image
          * add a **featured image** to at least 1 page
        1. Add a *blank* `Blog` **page** - just a page title and no content! We'll need this later.

        Since WordPress started as a blogging platform, the default homepage for all WordPress sites is a listing of your blog posts.

When using the DesktopServer app, you do not need to edit this file to set up a local server but some other applications as well as adding certain customizations may require edits.

        Themes are a collection of [template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/). Often templates contain code for a portion of a page (e.g. header, footer). 
        
        These partials fit together like a puzzle to generate full web pages.
        
        Some templates are re-used across multiple pages such as the header and footer. Some are only used for specific conditions.

        WordPress is based on PHP, so the files must use a `.php` extension.
        
        WordPress also has specific naming conventions for template files. (e.g. header.php is for header content)
        
        Content entered in the backend (posts, site title, etc) is stored in the *database*, allowing you to update themes files without losing your content.

        **How much PHP do you need to know?**
        
        Though WordPress is written in PHP, much of your customizations can be accomplished by using WordPress-specific PHP, *template tags*.  
        
        However, being able to recognize PHP tags and having a general grasp of the PHP syntax will help a lot. 
        
        Before we get into modifying themes, let's go over some PHP basics you'll encounter and get familiar with how the language works.

        # PHP Syntax

        PHP code is enclosed in special start `<?php` and end `?>` tags to process instructions and to jump in and out of “PHP mode”. 
        
        PHP executed on the server generates HTML which is then sent to the client (the browser). Anything outside of the opening and closing tags will be ignored by the PHP parser.
        
        ```php
        <?php PHP code in between here. ?>
        ```
        ```
        <?php 
        Can also open & close the php tags on different lines.
        ?>
        ```
      </script>
      </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # PHP Syntax & HTML 
        
        If you mix PHP with HTML, an opening and closing tag is required for each code block that is separated by non-PHP code. 
        
        ```xml
        <p>This is just HTML and will be ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php PHP code here. ?>
        
        <p>More HTML. Ignored by PHP.</p>
        <?php More PHP code here. ?>
        ```
        
        You can even mix PHP *between* HTML tags.
        
        ```xml
        <p>More HTML. Dynamic code here: <?php PHP code ?></p>
        ```
        
        These techniques are used quite often in WordPress.

        # Outputting PHP

        * `string` - series of characters, contained in single or double quotes  
        * `echo` – outputs strings
          * use a comma to separate multiple strings
          * add a semi-colon `;` at the end of the command
        
        ```
        <?php echo "I'm one string"; ?>
        <?php echo "I'm", "multiple", "strings."; ?>
        ```
        
        **Watch out!**  If single quotes were used, it would produce an error.  
        PHP will think the apostrophe in `I'm` closes the first quote. 
        
        ```xml
        <?php echo 'I'm one string.'; ?> /* this will produce an error */
        ```
        
        You can avoid that by using double quotes or *escaping* it with a backslash `\` like so:
        ```
        <?php echo 'I\'m escaping this string.'; ?>

        1. Create a new file (**File > New File**) in your editor and save it as **test.php** in your root folder, to be able to find it easily.
  
          ![](framework/img/workshop/test-folder-directory.png)
        1. Use an HTML tag to enclose the PHP content. Use `echo` to output a message
          ```
          <p><?php echo "Hello!"; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Save it. (**File > Save**)
        1. To view this page, navigate to **test.php** by adding a forward slash `/` and the file name to the end of the URL. 
          ```xml
          http://your-project-name.dev/test.php
          ```
        1. Remember, with `echo`, you can output multiple strings using commas. Try it!
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I", "like", "pizza."; ?></p>
          ```
        1. Make the output a little nicer by adding a space after "I" and "like".  
          ```  
          <p><?php echo "I ", "like ", "pizza."; ?></p>

        ![](framework/img/workshop/view-source.png)
        
        Remember, since PHP is a *server-side* language, it gets parsed on the server *first*, then outputs the content onto the page. Even if you view the source in the browser (client-side), you won't see the PHP tags.

        # Creating Dynamic Content
        
        Ok, that's great but how is that different from just writing HTML?  
        Remember, HTML is *static*, it doesn't change.
        
        When you're logged into WordPress, the admin toolbar shows your site title and username, using the data saved in the database.  
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/wp-admin-bar.png)
        
        It couldn't do that with just HTML! It changes *dynamically* based on the information added by the user and stored in the database.
        
        **Variables** can be used to store and retrieve this type of data.

      <script type="text/template">
        # PHP Variables
        
        To create a variable, *declare* it (name it) and give it a value. 
        
        Name it whatever you want but it *must* start with the `$` symbol and cannot contain spaces. WordPress uses underscores to separate words, though PHP also accepts camelCase.
        
        An `=` symbol is used to *assign* a value to the variable.
        
        Variables are case sensitive so the below example would be interpreted as three different variables.

        #PHP Variables
        
        Variables only *store* values so it sits there, waiting, until you need it. 
        
        Just like the previous examples, you can use `echo` to output the variable value. But you do **not** need the quotes.  
        
        That is only required for string types.
        ```
        <?php
        $mygreeting = "Hello!";
        
        echo $mygreeting;
        ?>
        ```

        # Class exercise: Variables
        
        Let's pretend we're creating the code for the Admin toolbar and create two variables for the website title and username.  
        
        Back in `test.php`, add your variables.  We won't be grabbing the actual database values for this example so just assign the value to the variable using a *string* value.
        
        ```php
        <?php 
        $site_title = "Ladies Learning Code";
        $username = "ladieslearningcode";
        ?>
        ```

        Then, output the PHP variables. They are wrapped in HTML anchor tags to output these values onto the page as a link.
        ```
        <a href="#"><?php echo $site_title; ?></a>
        <a href="#">Howdy, <?php echo $username; ?></a>
        ```
        
        The <!-- .element: class="note" -->`#` is just a placeholder for the link location usually contained in the `href`.

        * create your own!
        
        
        For example, `strlen()` is used to return the length of a string.
        
        ```
        <?php echo strlen("Hello class!"); ?>
        ```
        This will return “12” since there are 12 characters, including the space.

        function greeting() {

        Use a *parameter*, kind of like a placeholder, for the information you want to manipulate. The syntax for the parameter is just like a variable; use the `$` symbol.
        
        Let's revise the function and add a `$name` parameter.
        
        ```
        function greeting($name) {
          echo "Hello ", $name, "!"; // code to be executed
        }
        ```
        Now *call* the function with an argument.
        ```
        greeting("Rihanna"); // call the function with an argument
        greeting("Your Name"); // call the function with a different argument

        #Wordpress Template Tags
        
        In WordPress, many of the complexities required for displaying content have already been created as **template tags**. Some common template tags are:
        
        * `get_header()` - gets the header.php template file and includes it (and its content) in the current file. 
        * `the_title()` – tells WordPress to get the title of the page or post from the database
        * `bloginfo('name')` – tells WordPress to get the blog/website title from the database
        
        Notice that the syntax is just like the previous examples for calling a function? That's because they are functions!

        #Template tags & template files
        
        How do the template tags and template files all work together? In the **sydney** theme folder, the **header.php** file contains a line of code that looks like this:
        
        ```
        <h2 class="site-description"><?php bloginfo( 'description' ); ?></h2>
        ```  
        
        `bloginfo('description')` will get the **Tagline** value, entered in your general settings.
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/blog-info-settings.png)<!-- .element: width="70%" -->
        
        Adding the template tag between an HTML tag outputs the title into the browser in an `<h2>` tag and will display in the header of your site.
          
        If you change your tagline, that value replaces the current value in the database and will automatically update on your site as well.

        #Creating your own theme
                
        Earlier, we talked about [three ways to use themes](slides.html#theme-options).  Using a pre-made theme is the easiest option but sometimes you need more customizations.
        
        Custom themes allow for basically doing whatever you want! But it also requires building pretty much everything from scratch.
        
        Child Themes are the "in-between" option. You can add your own customizations but still leverage the features of a pre-built theme.

        Why use a child theme?
        
        * learn about theme dev by reverse engineering existing code
        * recommended for modifying an existing theme
        * inherits the functionality and styling of parent theme
        * main functionality, templates, etc, are already created
        
        If you modify a theme's files directly and it is updated, your modifications may be lost. By using a child theme your modifications will be preserved.

        #Class Exercise: Make a child theme
        
        **Step 1:** In your theme folder, create a new (empty) folder for your child theme files. Any theme can be used as a child theme but this workshop examples will use the **sydney** theme.
        
        Name the folder the same name as the parent theme, but with `-child` appended to it.
          
        ![](framework/img/workshop/child-theme-folder.png)
        
        Only add specific files to be modified in the -child theme folder, not all of the theme files.

        <script type="text/template">
          #Class Exercise: Make a child theme 
          
          **Step 2**: In your text editor, create a new CSS file (**File > New File**) and save it as **style.css**. It has to be named *exactly* as **style.css** and saved in your child theme folder, **sydney-child**.
          
          Your stylesheet **must** contain specific header comments, at the top of the file, to tell WordPress information about the theme, including the parent theme.
            
          ```css
          /*
          Theme Name: The name of your theme
          Theme URI: http://www.yourthemewebsite.com/
          Description: A short description about your theme.
          Author: Name
          Author URI: http://www.authorwebsite.com
          Template: The parent folder name
          Version: 0.1
          */
          ```
        
          Only the **Theme Name** and **Template** comments are required. The **Template** has to be the exact name of the parent theme's folder.  This is how it connects the child theme to the parent theme.
          
          All of the other information is optional but commonly added.
          
          Here's the LLC project example:
          
          ```css
          /*
          Theme Name: LLC WordPress Workshop Project
          Theme URI: http://ladieslearningcode.com
          Description: This theme is used for demonstration purposes.
          Author: Ladies Learning Code
          Author URI: http://ladieslearningcode.com
          Template: sydney
          Version: 0.1
          */

        <script type="text/template">
          #Class Exercise: Make a child theme  
          
          **Step 3**: Create a **functions.php** file. This file is used for adding features and functionality to a WordPress site. 
          
          For a child theme, a script is needed to enqueue the parent and child theme stylesheets. This will ensure that both the parent and child theme's CSS will load properly. 
          
          Add the below script to your **functions.php** file.
          
          ```
          <?php
          
          add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_enqueue_styles' );
          function theme_enqueue_styles() {
              wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );
          }
          ```
          
          And that's it!

        # Making Changes
        
        Now that your child theme is all set up, how do you make changes? Since child themes leverage existing code, there's a little detective work required to figure out where to make the changes.
        
        Getting familiar with the various [template files](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Template_Files_List) and using the browser developer tools will help with narrowing down the search for content and making CSS updates.
        
        When getting started, be prepared to continuously refer to the [Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/) and a lot of trial & error!

        The page title field can't be left empty when you add the post or page but you might not want it to actually show on the page. 
        
        To make that change, you'll need to find the template file used for these pages to make the edits.
        
        WordPress uses a **template hierarchy** to determine what type of content gets displayed and where it gets displayed.
        
        Some template files, (i.e. header & footer), are used on all of pages, while others are used only under specific conditions.

        #Template Hierarchy
  
        The template *hierarchy* determines *which* template is used to display specific types of content for the different post types (pages, posts, custom posts, etc.)
        
        Let's look at the different templates & their place in the hierarchy and determine which template is most likely to contain the content we are looking to revise. 
        
        Note that for the next slide, "front page" refers to the page you see when you first go to your site (often referred to as home page or landing page).

          * shows latest blog posts 
          * this content will default to `index.php` if `home.php` does not exist

          * single posts (for each individual post)
        * **front-page.php**
          * home page, whether set as a page or posts index
          * this template takes precedence over `home.php` 
          * if `front-page.php` does not exist, WordPress will either default to `home.php` or `page.php` depending on the **Settings**
          * if neither `home.php` or `page.php` exist, it will default to `index.php`

        `index.php` can be used for single (static) page types. But if `page.php` exists, it will take precedence.
        
        BUT `front-page.php` could be also used be used for displaying the home page. However, in our current theme (Sydney), this template isn't included.  
        
        So... the About and Home pages must be using the `page.php` template.
        
        Let's take a look at this file and do a simple test to confirm this is the correct template being used.

        (The template hierarchy is documented in the codex as well as in this <!-- .element: class="note" --> [flowchart](framework/img/workshop/template-hierarchy.png).)

        #The WordPress Loop

        The Loop is used for outputting content into the theme files by retrieving each post to be displayed and how to format it. That's how one template file can be used to handle multiple pages.
        
        The basic loop looks like this:
        
        ```php
        <?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>
            <?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
              ... Display post content
            <?php endwhile; ?>
        <?php endif; ?>
        ```

        #The WordPress Loop
          
        * the `have_posts()` function checks if there are any posts (true/false)
        * the `if` condition is true as long as there are posts
        * a `while` loop continues to execute as long as the condition in true
        * the while loop contains instructions for what content to display, from the posts
        
        ```php
        <?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?> // if we have posts
            <?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?> // while we have posts
              // add instructions here to pull out some or all of the content contained in the 
              // database for that post - usually with a combination of HTML & template tags
            <?php endwhile; ?> // end while
        <?php endif; ?> // end the if statement

        Back in `page.php`, within the loop, let's look at this line:
        
        ```
        <?php get_template_part( 'content', 'page' ); ?>
        ```
        
        This is where the `<h1 class="title-post"></h1>` snippet we were looking for was supposed to be. But instead we see something else.
        
        Remember, all WordPress template tags follow this syntax, `name_of_tag()` so this must be a template tag! 
        
        Don't know what it does? Look it up in the [codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_template_part).

        The description in the [codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_template_part) says:

        >Load a template part into a template. Makes it easy for a theme to reuse sections of code and an easy way for child themes to replace sections of their parent theme.
        
        Looking further into the documentation, this basically means, look for a template file called `content-page.php`. 
        
        This template tag allows you to create template files outside of the WordPress defined template files (`page.php`, `home.php`, etc).

        There is more you can do with theme customizations but the process is pretty similar to the process shown in the past examples.  
        
        1. decide what change to make 
        1. find the template file where content is being outputted
        1. make a copy and save it in your child theme folder
        1. revise the HTML & template tags/PHP as necessary
        
        To make CSS changes, getting to know the browser development tools will be super handy.  The good news is, you can make all your revisions in your `style.css` file and don't have to search for template files!

        #CSS Syntax & terminology
        
        **Selectors** are used to determine which HTML element(s) to apply the styles to.
        
        **Properties** determine the type of style to be applied to the element (e.g. colour). Values are specific to the property (e.g. red). 
        
        **Declarations** are style rules, written using `property:value` pairs, are wrapped by curly brackets `{}` and each must end with a semi-colon `;` to indicate that the instruction is complete.
        
        ```
        selector {
          property: value;
        }

            color: #444; /* selects the HTML element with this id (there should be only one) */

        #*Cascading* Style Sheets
        
        In CSS, the style rules "cascade" and are executed from top to bottom. For example, if you use the same selector, the one that comes after will override the one that came before.
        
        ```
        h1 {
          color: red;
        }
        h1 {
          color: blue;  /* this style will be override the previous declaration */
        }
        ```

        When setting up the child theme, the [enqueue script](slides.html#enqueue) added in **functions.php** ensures that the themes are loaded in such a way that the child theme css can override the styles in the parent theme.

      <script type="text/template">
        #Inheritance and specificity
        
        In CSS, styles can be inherited from parent to child elements using the family tree relationship between the elements.
        
        ```
        <body>
          <h1>My Website</h1><!-- child of body -->
          <p>This is a paragraph.</p><!-- sibling of h1 -->
        </body>
        ```
        ```
        body {
          color: blue;
          font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        h1 {
          color: black;
        }
        ```
        In the above example, the CSS properties in the body selector is inherited by the descendant elements (all nested elements). 
        
        However, when a more *specific* selector is used (e.g. h1), it will override the inherited values.

        On the blog page, let's change the font size and colour of the headings and paragraph.  Open the browser developer tools to most effectively find the right selector to use.

        Uh oh. Only the `font-size` changed but not the `color`? Inspecting the element shows that (1) the new css *is* loaded and (2) the `font-size` *is* overriding the previous styles. But still no colour change.

        #Update style.css 
        
        The colour of this heading uses a *different* selector, one that targets the link *inside* of the `<h1>` tag. That's why the CSS wasn't working.

      <script type="text/template">
        #Update style.css 
        
        There are two selectors used to set the colour. How do you know which one to use?
        
        When inspecting the element, #1 in the example is crossed out. That means a more specific selector (the one not crossed out) is overriding it. So, the #2 selector should be used.

          color: #d65050;
        }
        ```
        
        This snippet shows that all links (`a`) contained within all of the headings (`h1, h2, etc`) show the same colour.
        
        If you only want to change the colour for *this* specific heading, use just `h2 a` as your selector. When multiple selectors are combined, the specific element being inspected will be highlighted.

        #Child Themes & CSS Specificity
        
        You can write CSS without inspecting elements each time. But based on the rules of CSS specificity, sometimes the style may not show as expected.
        
        Another option is to use the `body_class();` template tag. This tag generates *classes*, based on the template and can be used for CSS.
        
        This should be included in the `<body>` tag in `header.php` to use specificity rules to apply styles to elements on the entire page.
          
        ```
        <body <?php body_class(); ?>>

        #Next Steps: Custom themes
        
        Phew! Why not just write it all yourself? You can!
        
        The main difference between child & custom themes is you'll have to make all the template files; the HTML, template tags, loops, css, etc. Or use a starter theme to get some basic functionality to start with.
        
        Custom themes, even with a starter theme, will require a bit more HTML/CSS/PHP knowledge.
        
        Rule of thumb: Use a child theme to make a few changes. Use a custom theme if you need a lot of customization.

        WordPress plugins are bits of software that can be uploaded to your WordPress site to extend the functionality.
        
        For example, [Akismet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/) is a plugin to help with spam comments.
        
        Adding functionality with Plugins range from adding social media buttons and  related posts, to Google Analytics to adding eCommerce options and everything in between.  
        
        Just like themes, not all plugins are created equal.  Browse for plugins in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/popular/) and look out for things such as number of downloads, ratings and if it was updated recently.
        
        Plugins can be managed under the **Plugins** menu.

        #Next Steps: Going Live
        
        Before going live, you'll need to register a domain name (www.mysite.com) and get hosting. Here are a couple domain & hosting suggestions:
        
        * [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2085384) - Domain and hosting - Use coupon code **LLC40** to get $40 off your registration
        * [hover.com](http://hover.com/ladiescode) - save 10% with the promo code "learningcode"

        Why keep your domains and hosting separate? Learn more about Hover [here](http://ladieslearningcode.com/getting-hosted-domains-with-hover/).
        
        After securing domain & hosting, you'll need to move your local files and database to the live server.
